## Principle
Welcome to the first technical lab hosted by The Blockchain Collaborative! This course will be taught by Nathan Galindo, and if you have any questions, you can reach him via telegram @nathanzebedee. This first walkthrough will focus on setting up your local environment for building decentralized blockchain applications (dApps), and will briefly introduce you to the Solidity programming language towards the end as we program a very simple smart contract. 

To access the video recording of this walkthrough, please refer to the link: [01-hello-world-video]()

Disclaimer: these walkthroughs were conducted using a macOS environment. If you are not using a macOS environment, some of these processes might be different for you. Please be aware of this moving forward.
